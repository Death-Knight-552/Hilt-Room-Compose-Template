# Starter Project using Hilt, Compose, Room DB, and KSP

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ <br/>
Welcome to the starter project template that combines the power of Hilt for dependency injection, Jetpack Compose for building UI, Room Database for local data storage, and Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP) for annotation processing. This template will kickstart your Android app development journey, allowing you to focus on building amazing features right from the beginning.

## Project Overview

This starter project provides a solid foundation for your Android app development with the following key components:

- **Hilt:** Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in your project. It integrates seamlessly with Jetpack libraries and simplifies dependency injection in Android apps.

- **Compose:** Jetpack Compose is a modern, fully declarative UI toolkit for building native Android UIs. It allows you to create beautiful and responsive UIs with less code compared to the traditional XML-based UI development.

- **Room Database:** Room is an SQLite object mapping library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow for more robust database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.

- **Kotlin Symbol Processing (KSP):** KSP is a tool for Kotlin that reads and generates Kotlin code. It allows for more efficient annotation processing in Kotlin projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with this starter project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Death-Knight-552/Hilt-Room-Compose-Template.git
```

2. **Open in Android Studio:**
- Open Android Studio and select "Open an Existing Project."
- Navigate to the cloned repository and open the project.

3. **Run the App:**
- Connect your Android device or use an emulator.
- Click on the "Run" button in Android Studio to build and run the app on your device/emulator.

## Project Structure

This is a completely barebone project. It is made prom android studio template for empty compose activity. 

## Plan for the future

I am planning to add a simple room database with the data class, dao, repository, viewmodel. I want to follow a proper architeccture but I do not know anything about them. So it is currently on hold.
